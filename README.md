# Awesome HP Thinn Client T520
A work in Progress - After tinkering with Raspberry Pi and Orange Pi, I quickly realized i needed comething with x86 cores architecture,
While casually looking in the internet I found an old Thinn client HP T520 - Nothig powerfull at all , only two amd cores and no hyperthreting, but where this awesome journey started was after reading that the TDP is only 6 Watts, and 10 watts at full load! Thats close to what a RPI consumes

This means with the help of a USB C trigger board, a DC to DC converter, and some pheriferals I should have an awesome Battery powered self contained X86 hacking station. or in other words an awesome Doomsday Cyberdeck
